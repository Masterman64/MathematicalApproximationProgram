# MathematicalApproximationProgram
My Honors Project for the 2023 Fall Semester at Sam Houston State University. In this program, the user inputs algebraic formulas for the program to calculate, and the program will approximate the solution(s) for every formula using the Bisection Method, Fixed Point Iteration, and Newton's method, and then outputs the results in a text file.
